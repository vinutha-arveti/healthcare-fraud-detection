# healthcare-fraud-detection
Machine learning project to detect fraudulent healthcare claims using classification models with performance evaluation and insights.
## Problem Statement
Healthcare fraud results in significant financial losses for insurance providers and healthcare systems.  
The goal of this project is to identify potentially fraudulent healthcare claims using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of healthcare claim records containing both legitimate and fraudulent cases.  
It includes features related to patient details, claim amounts, procedures, and provider information.

> Note: The dataset used for this project is for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Approach
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation

## Model Used
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
The model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of **92%**, demonstrating strong performance in identifying fraudulent claims.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Power BI
